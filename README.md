#### 🎯 Why?

Why not? I've got some free time, so I decided to build something.

#### 🌟 Features

1. 🛠 <b>Customizable Limiting</b>: Apply rate limiting to individual APIs with tailored rules.
2. 🖥️ <b> Dashboard </b>: Manage all your API rules in one place, with a user-friendly dashboard.
3. ⚙️ <b>Plug-and-Play Middleware</b>: Seamless integration with various frameworks, just plug it in and go.

#### ⚙️ Use Cases

1. Preventing Abuse: Limit the number of requests an API can handle to prevent abuse or malicious activities.
2. Cost Management: Avoid overages on third-party API calls by rate limiting outgoing requests to those services.

#### ⚠️ Important

- Current Limitation: Only supports Token Bucket Rate Limiting, which may not suit all scenarios.
- Under Development: This is a hobby project and still in progress. Not recommended for production use—yet! Stay tuned for v1.0.
